# Memory-Scramble-Game

## Project Title
Memory Scramble Game

Memory Scramble Game is a memory card game designed to challenge and enhance your memory skills. This game is suitable for users of all ages who enjoy puzzle and memory games.

## Description

The RIRI Memory Scramble Game allows users to enter the desired number of cards. The game starts with all cards faced down, and the user tries to find matching pairs of cards. When the user finds a matching pair, the cards remain faced up. If the selected cards do not match, they will be turned face down after one second, allowing the user to try again.

This project is part of the Software Construction course at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Masters Program, Cairo University.

## Features
- User-defined number of cards for a customizable game experience.
- Interactive gameplay where users flip cards to find matches.
- Cards remain face up when a match is found.
- Non-matching cards are turned face down after one second.
- Educational and fun, helping to improve memory and concentration skills.

## Tech Stack
**Client (User Interface):**

- **JavaFX:** A modern UI toolkit for Java applications, providing a rich set of features for building desktop applications.
 
- **Swing:** Swing can be used for creating graphical user interfaces, though JavaFX is generally preferred for new applications due to its more modern capabilities.

**Development Tools:** 

- **IDE :** IntelliJ IDEA: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that support Java development, offering tools for coding, debugging, and testing.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):**  JDK 11  which provides the necessary libraries and tools for developing Java applications.

**Version Control:** 
- **Git:** Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating with team members.
- **GitHub**: Platform for hosting the project's code repository and facilitating collaboration.

## Installation
**Prerequisites** 
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **JDK 11 or higher**: You need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher installed on your system. You can download and install JDK from the official website:
    - [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
    - [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/11/)

- **Terminal or Command Prompt**: You should have a terminal or command prompt installed on your system. This is required to execute commands for building and running the project.

## Run Locally
To run the project using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RehamTammam1/Memory-Scramble-Game
```
2. **Open your IDE**: Launch your preferred IDE where your Java project is located.

2. **Import the project**: If the project is not already imported into the IDE, import it by selecting the project directory.

3. **Set up the run configuration**:

  - For IntelliJ IDEA: Right-click on your main class file (the class containing the `main` method) and select "Run MemoryGameApp.main()".
  - For Eclipse: Right-click on your main class file, go to "Run As" and select "Java Application".
  - For NetBeans: Right-click on your project, select "Run" and then "Run Project".

4. **Run the project**: Once the run configuration is set up, run the project from the IDE. The IDE will compile the code (if necessary) and execute the main method of your main class.
